    "#### The purpose of this notebook is to investigate the chances of test score being more than the validation score for question 3(d) of homework 4.\n",
    "This experiment shows that there is in fact a high probability that the for this particular case the test score is higher than the validation score which counters the explanation provided. Given the results herein, we cannot simply say the reason for a higher test score than validation score is being lucky."
